## Objective

Systematic analysis of correlations between all sample variables (`colData`) and the principal components. Also including the 2 QC variables.
See [video](drive.google.com/file/d/18T_VPw746RIJRCksY4TFWtK5PtImStkY/view) from minute 8 onwards.
- High values mean high correlation.
- In the example, redundant variables which have very high correlation with PC1 e.g.
- can identify sample variables for possible diff expression analysis model inclusion to adjust for batch effects

The final plot is similar to what we do in the `autoplot()` method for `HermesDataCor()` objects.
